### Task <a name="task"></a>

The program represents a calculator for matrix multiplication.
-- --

### Description <a name="description"></a>

Matrix multiplication is one of the most interesting topics in linear algebra. In this program we can set the number of
rows and columns for each matrix, specify the numbers and get the answer with a description of the operations of the
obtained result. The matrix implementation was inspired by the presentations of the course B6B01LAG Doc.RNDr. Ji≈ô√≠
Velebil, Ph.D. ([Algebra of matrices](https://math.fel.cvut.cz/en/people/velebil/files/b6b01lag/lag_handout04b.pdf)).

### Implementation <a name="implementation"></a>

##### Programme functionality:

- The program asks the user for the dimensions of matrices A and B (number of rows and columns).
- After entering the dimensions, the programme asks for the elements of matrices A and B one by one.
- The matrices A and B are multiplied and the result is displayed on the screen.

##### Multiple Threads:

The code does not use multiple threads explicitly. It performs matrix multiplication using a loop structure, but there
is no use of multithreading or parallelism. The multiplication is done using single-threaded calculations.

##### Single Thread Optimized Implementation:

The program is optimised for matrix multiplication using SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) instructions, which
allow a single instruction to perform operations on multiple data simultaneously. This speeds up the matrix
multiplication process through parallel computation.

##### Language Extensions:

The code does not use any explicit language extensions like OpenMP or variable length arrays (VLA). It appears to use
standard C++ features and libraries.

##### Non-portable Libraries:

The code does not appear to use non-portable libraries such as POSIX or Win32. It relies on standard C++ libraries for
input/output and vector operations.

### Running project <a name="running"></a>

If you are using CLion, you can run the program by opening the project ``matrix_mult.cpp`` and clicking the Run button.

Or you can run the program in the terminal by following these steps:

1) To get the executable file, you need to write this command in the terminal:

```shell 
g++ -o matrix_mult  matrix_mult.cpp  
```

To get the executable file with optimization, you need to write this command in the terminal:

```shell
g++ -O3 -o matrix_mult  matrix_mult.cpp
```

2) To run the program, you need to write this command in the terminal:

```shell
./matrix_mult
```

#### Help:

If you want to get help, you need to write this command in the terminal:

```shell
./matrix_mult --help
```

And you will see this description in the terminal:

``` 
Matrix Multiplication Program
This program performs matrix multiplication of two square matrices.
Usage: ./matrix_mult [options]
Options:
--help    Display this help message
Description:
After running the matrix_mult program, you will see the following interactive process in the terminal:
- The program will prompt you to enter the dimensions of square matrices A and B.
- After entering the dimensions of matrices A and B, the program will prompt you to enter the elements of both matrices in turn.
- The program will display the actions of multiplication of numbers by each other and the matrix obtained after multiplication.
- The program will then exit.
```

If you try calling another options that is not exist, you will get invalid message:
``Unknown switch: [your written switch]``

#### Scenario

After running the program, you will see the following interactive process in the terminal:

1) The program will prompt you to enter the dimensions of square matrices A and B.
2) After entering the dimensions of matrices A and B, the program will prompt you to enter the elements of both matrices
   in turn.
3) The program will display the actions of multiplication of numbers by each other and the matrix obtained after
   multiplication.
4) The program will then exit.

#### Example:

```
Enter number of rows for matrix A: 2
Enter number of columns for matrix A: 2

Enter number of rows for matrix B: 2
Enter number of columns for matrix B: 2

Enter matrix A (2x2):
1 2
3 4

Enter matrix B (2x2):
5 6
7 8

c11 = 1 * 5 + 2 * 7 = 19
c12 = 1 * 6 + 2 * 8 = 22
c21 = 3 * 5 + 4 * 7 = 43
c22 = 3 * 6 + 4 * 8 = 50

Result:
   19	   22	
   43	   50
```

#### Errors:

The program also contains error handling. If you enter the wrong data, you will see the following error messages:

##### Example 1:

```
Enter number of rows for matrix A: cpp
Invalid input for number of rows for matrix A
```

##### Example 2:

```
Enter number of rows for matrix A: 2
Enter number of columns for matrix A: pcc
Invalid input for number of columns for matrix A
```

##### Example 3:

```
Enter number of rows for matrix A: -1
Invalid number of rows for matrix A
```

##### Example 4:

```
Enter number of rows for matrix A: 1
Enter number of columns for matrix A: 2

Enter number of rows for matrix B: 1
Enter number of columns for matrix B: 1
Invalid matrix dimensions: Number of columns in matrix A must match number of rows in matrix B
```

##### Example 5:

```
Enter number of rows for matrix A: 2
Enter number of columns for matrix A: 2

Enter number of rows for matrix B: 2
Enter number of columns for matrix B: 2

Enter matrix A (2x2):
1 2 3
Invalid format: Entered row has more than the required number of elements
```

##### Example 6:

```
Enter number of rows for matrix A: 2
Enter number of columns for matrix A: 2

Enter number of rows for matrix B: 2
Enter number of columns for matrix B: 2

Enter matrix A (2x2):
1
Invalid input for matrix element
```

### Testing <a name="testing"></a>

The project contains [testing folder](https://github.com/UnknownPug/matrix-algorithms/tree/main/testing) where you can find different matrices and their multiplication results.

### Measurements <a name="measurements"></a>

Measurements were performed on an 8-core Apple M1 3.2GHz CPU with 16GB of RAM.

To measure the time, I used the ``chrono`` library.

##### This is the result of the measurements by running the program in the CLion:

| File          | Type      | Single-threaded |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------|
| testing_1.txt | 2x2       | < 1 ms          |
| testing_2.txt | 3x3       | < 1 ms          |
| testing_3.txt | 4x4       | < 1 ms          |
| testing_4.txt | 5x5       | < 1 ms          |
| testing_5.txt | different | < 1 ms          |
| testing_6.txt | 10x10     | < 1 ms          |
| testing_7.txt | 12x12     | < 2 ms          |
| testing_8.txt | 15x15     | ~ 2 ms          |
| testing_9.txt | 20x20     | ~ 6 ms          |

##### This is the result of the measurements by running the program in the terminal with the optimization:

| File          | Type      | Single-threaded |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------|
| testing_1.txt | 2x2       | < 1 ms          |
| testing_2.txt | 3x3       | < 1 ms          |
| testing_3.txt | 4x4       | < 1 ms          |
| testing_4.txt | 5x5       | < 1 ms          |
| testing_5.txt | different | < 1 ms          |
| testing_6.txt | 10x10     | ~ 4 ms          |
| testing_7.txt | 12x12     | ~ 6 ms          |
| testing_8.txt | 15x15     | ~ 11 ms         |
| testing_9.txt | 20x20     | ~ 20 ms         |
